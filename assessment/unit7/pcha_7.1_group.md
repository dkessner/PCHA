No calculator.  Have fun!

\vspace{.2in}

__1.__ Evaluate the following:

a. $\log_{2}(32)$
\vspace{.25in}

b. $\log_{10}(10000)$
\vspace{.25in}

c. $\ln(e^5)$
\vspace{.25in}

d. $e^{ln 10}$
\vspace{.25in}


__2.__ Suppose a bacterial colony has an initial population of 500
and has a population of 4000 at $t=9$ hours.  

a. Model the population $P(t)$ as an exponential in the following form.
(i.e. find $P_0$ and $k$).  Check your work.

$$P(t) = P_0 e^{kt}$$

\vspace{1.5in}

b. What is the doubling time of the colony?

\vspace{1in}

c. Model the population as an exponential in the following form.  What
does $T$ represent?  
$$P(t) = P_0 2^{t/T}$$.

__3.__ Graph the following: 

$y = 2^x$ and $y = \log_2 x$ on the same graph.

\vspace{4in}

$y = 10^x$ and $y = \log_{10}x$ on the same graph.
