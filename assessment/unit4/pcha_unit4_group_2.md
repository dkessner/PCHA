__1.__ Factor the following polynomial completely, both over
$\mathbb{R}$ (as a product of real linear and irreducible
quadratic factors) and over $\mathbb{C}$ (as a product of complex
linear factors).  Sketch the graph of the function.

$$p(x) = x^4-2x^3+x^2+2x-2$$

__2.__ Factor the following polynomial completely, both over
$\mathbb{R}$ (as a product of real linear and irreducible
quadratic factors) and over $\mathbb{C}$ (as a product of complex
linear factors).  Sketch the graph of the function.  A little
bird tells you that $2-2i$ is a zero.

$$q(x) = x^5 - 4x^4 + 5x^3 + 14x^2 - 32x + 16$$
