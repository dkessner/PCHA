__3.__ Factor the following polynomial completely, both over
$\mathbb{R}$ (as a product of real linear and irreducible
quadratic factors) and over $\mathbb{C}$ (as a product of complex
linear factors).  Sketch the graph of the function.

$$p(x) = -2x^3 + 7x^2 + 17x - 10$$

__4.__ Factor the following polynomial completely, both over
$\mathbb{R}$ (as a product of real linear and irreducible
quadratic factors) and over $\mathbb{C}$ (as a product of complex
linear factors).  Sketch the graph of the function.  A little
bird tells you that $2+3i$ is a zero.

$$q(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10x^2 + 12x - 39$$

__5.__ Sketch the graph of the following rational function:
$$ r(x) = \dfrac{x^2-3x+2}{(x^2-4x+4)(x-3)} $$
