# Introduction

Pre-Calculus Honors Accelerated (PCHA) is a fast-moving course, and we will
cover a wide variety of interesting topics on the way to calculus, the
development of which was a major milestone in human understanding of the
universe.

As we visit these topics, we will also do some coding to aid our understanding
of these mathematical concepts, to see some of the relationships between
mathematics and computer science, and to have fun and enjoy our mathematical
skills.
