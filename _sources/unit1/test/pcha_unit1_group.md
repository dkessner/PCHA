__No calculator, no notes -- just your brain!  Have fun!__

__1.__ Evaluate the following:
\vspace{.1in}

a) $\cot\frac{\pi}{2}$
\vspace{1in}

b) $\tan\frac{5\pi}{4}$
\vspace{1in}

c) $\sec\frac{5\pi}{3}$
\vspace{1in}

d) $\cos\frac{25\pi}{2}$
\vspace{1in}

e) $\tan^{-1}(\sin\frac{25\pi}{2})$
\vspace{1in}

f) $\sin^{-1}\left(\tan(\cos^{-1}(-1))\right)$
\vspace{1in}

__2.__ A spider jumps onto a hamster wheel at the right-most (3 o'clock)
position.  This scares the hamster, which tries to run away from the spider
quickly, rotating the hamster wheel at a rate of 1 revolution every 6 seconds.
The hamster wheel has a radius of 8 inches and the bottom of the wheel is 2
inches above the ground.

a) Graph the x and y position of the spider, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$.  Find equations
for both $x(t)$ and $y(t)$.

b) Calculate the position $(x(t), y(t))$ of the spider at $t=3$ and $t=6$.
Make sure your answers make sense.  When does the spider reach the hamster
(assuming the hamster stays at the bottom of the wheel)?

__3.__  Write down all the relevant properties (period, amplitude, shifts/scales,
asymptotes) of the following trig functions, and then graph by hand.  Write
the domain and range of the function.

__a.__ $f(x) = 2\sec(x-\frac{\pi}{2}) - 1$


\vspace{3.5in}

__b.__ $g(x) = \frac{1}{2}\cot(\frac{x}{3}) + 1$
