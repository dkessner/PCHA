## Class information

Pre-Calculus Honors Accelerated (PCHA)  
2022-23  
Dr. Kessner  


### Grading

- 50% group work
- 50% individual assessments


### Homework 

You are _not_ required to do every assigned homework problem.  However, you are
responsible for knowing how to do every problem.  In other words, don't waste
your time on things you already know how to do, and spend time on the material
where you need the most practice.  If you skip problems, please make a note on
your homework that you've skipped them (this is for you, not for me).  I highly
encourage you to write notes to yourself on your homework to remind yourself
what to look out for as you prepare for assessments.  


### About the course

This is a fast-paced course, with a lot of material to cover to prepare you for
AP Calculus BC next year.  Because of the amount of material, we won't always
have time to do an example for every type of problem, and we might not get to
discuss every homework problem in class.  This puts more responsibility on you
to make sure that you understand the material and that you are prepared for the
next lesson.  This class will be challenging, but I am here to help you.  Don't
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions at all.

The benefit of moving so quickly in this course is that we will have the
opportunity to think about a large variety of interesting ideas in mathematics.
In addition, we will do some coding in Python and/or Javascript to explore some
topics and have some fun with the ideas we discuss in class.
