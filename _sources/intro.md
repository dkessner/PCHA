Here's a fun quote from an article "Calculus Is Good for You"
that appeared in _Scientific American_ in 1871 (150 years ago!).

> It is admitted by all metaphysicians and educators that the calculus brings
> into play more faculties of the mind than any other branch of learning.
> Recognizing this fact, professors should consider their institution a mental
> gymnasium, which gives the mind exercise that enables it to perform its highest
> destiny. Herein is the value of solving problems in the calculus, and indeed of
> all other branches of pure mathematicsâ€”that by dealing in abstract ideas, they
> prepare the mind to apply itself vigorously to profound or complicated subjects
> connected with the realities of life."
